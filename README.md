# Language Classification with Machine Learning

This project aims to classify languages in text data using various machine learning algorithms and compare their performance metrics such as precision, accuracy, and time complexity.

## Overview

Language classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications ranging from language detection in web content to language identification in multilingual documents. In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms to automatically classify languages in text data.

<!-- ## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of randomly generated English sentences translated into Bengali, Russian, and Kazakh using the Google Translate API. Each sentence in the dataset is labeled with its corresponding language.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

We will explore the following machine learning algorithms for language classification:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of each algorithm will be evaluated using the following metrics:

- Precision
- Accuracy
- Time Complexity

## Directory Structure

- `dataset_generator.py`: Python script for generating the dataset.
- `main.py`: Python script for running the language classification experiment.
- `dataset/`: Directory containing the generated dataset.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained machine learning models.
- `results/`: Directory to save performance metrics and evaluation results.
